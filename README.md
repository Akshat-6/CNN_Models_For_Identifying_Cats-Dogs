# CNN_Models_For_Identifying_Cats-Dogs
In this project we created 3 models where the accuracy increases with every model and you get to understand how actually the 3rd model actually detects the images correctly.

Trained and compared 3 CNN models to understand accuracy improvement and visual recognition in image classification tasks.

🧠 CNN Image Classifier: Model Evolution & Accuracy Comparison
In this project, we developed three Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models using a custom image dataset to gradually improve accuracy and performance. The objective was to analyze how each subsequent model better understands and classifies images, with the third model achieving the best results.

🗂️ Dataset

Includes multiple image classes.

Ideal for multi-class classification with increasing CNN complexity.

📌 Project Goals
Create and compare three CNN models of increasing complexity.

Understand how depth and architecture affect image classification accuracy.

Visualize the learning process and evaluate performance metrics.

🚀 Model Progression
Model	Layers & Parameters	Accuracy	Highlights
Model 1	Basic CNN (1 conv layer)	Lower	Struggles with complex images
Model 2	Intermediate CNN (2 conv layers + pooling)	Medium	Improved feature detection
Model 3	Advanced CNN (multiple conv + dropout + dense)	Highest	Generalizes well, detects patterns accurately
